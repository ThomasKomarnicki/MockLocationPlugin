# MockLocationPlugin

This Intellij plugin allows you to send mock gps coordinates to an Android emulator in an easy to use fasion. The plugin lives within Android Studio so you don't need to interrupt your debugging process by opening DDMS. There are a few different gps emluating tools built in to the plugin to replicate real device location changes:
- Emulate Gps coordinates from a start location to an end location
- Emulate a user definable set of gps coordinates
- Emulate a single Gps coordinate

## Important usage notes:
An Android emulator must be running on the specified port. A physical device can not recieve fake gps coordinates.
